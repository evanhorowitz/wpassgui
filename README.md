Walkman Playlist Assistant Super Script (GUI Edition)

I made this little tool for Walkman devices (NW-A5X and below) that do not run Android. Playlist files were difficult to make considering the formatting, so I wrote a quick tool to do all that for me. 

Supports WAV, FLAC, MP3, M4A, WMA, OGG, and AAC. Can easily support more by just editing the code. 

# How it works:

-Select the Music folder you would like to scan for files.

-If its a single playlist, select the folder and name of the playlist file.
-If you would like the software to generate a playlist for each subfolder in the folder you selected, select the folder you would like it to generate the files in. It generates files based on the folder name.

-Generate the file.

-yay


-Also theres a file compare tab now. Lets you make sure your walkmans music folder is up to date with your PCs music folder.
# Disclaimer:

This is badly written in Python and compiled using PyInstaller. Built for both Windows and Linux. Tested on Windows 11 23H2 and OpenSUSE. Feel free to do whatever you would like with this tool.
