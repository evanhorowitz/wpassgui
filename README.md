Walkman Playlist Assistant Super Script (GUI Edition)

I made this little tool for Walkman devices (NW-A5X and below) that do not run Android. Playlist files were difficult to make considering the formatting, so I wrote a quick tool to do all that for me.

This is badly written in Python and compiled using PyInstaller. The current build is compiled for Linux, Windows is in progress.

Tested in Linux OpenSUSE with future testing possibly coming. Feel free to do whatever you would like with this tool.
