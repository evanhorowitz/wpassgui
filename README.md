Walkman Playlist Assistant Super Script (GUI Edition)

I made this little tool for Walkman devices (NW-A5X and below) that do not run Android. Playlist files were difficult to make considering the formatting, so I wrote a quick tool to do all that for me.

Tested in Linux OpenSUSE with future testing possibly coming. Feel free to do whatever you would like with this tool.
