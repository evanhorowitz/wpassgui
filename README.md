Walkman Playlist Assistant Super Script (GUI Edition)

I made this little tool for Walkman devices (NW-A5X and below) that do not run Android. Playlist files were difficult to make considering the formatting, so I wrote a quick tool to do all that for me. 

Supports WAV, FLAC, MP3, M4A, WMA, OGG, and AAC. Can easily support more by just editing the code. 

# How it works:

-Select the Music folder you would like to scan for files.

-Select the root directory that you are going to store the playlist file in.

-Name the playlist file.

-Generate the file.

-yay

# Disclaimer:

This is badly written in Python and compiled using PyInstaller. Built for both Windows and Linux. Tested on Windows 11 23H2 and OpenSUSE. Feel free to do whatever you would like with this tool.
